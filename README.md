Hominid Fossil Guide

http://batkocl1.github.io/HFG

This is a an edited fork of the Digital Atlas of Egyptian Archaeology which was created through Matrix (description below).

I would like to thank Dr. Ethan Watrall and Brian Geyer for their guidance through the original assignment, and Brian for his additional guidance in creating this adaptation that I have titled the Hominid Fossil Guide. The Digital Atlas of Egyptian Archaeology is part of a larger effort, but Ethan and Brian were major actors in its success. The Hominid Fossil Guide serves as an interactive map of human evolution using the type specimens of each hominid species. All the information on the species pages was taken from information provided in lectures by Dr. Joseph Hefner in ANP 440 - SS15. I edited files in the DAEA fork to accomplish the goals of this project.

Digital Atlas of Egyptian Archaeology

http://matrix-msu.github.io/daea/

Collaborative project in the Fall 2014 ANP455: Ancient Egyptian Archaeology class (http://anthropology.msu.edu/anp455-fs14) at Michigan State University. Students all chose a specific site on which to write a site report (details can be found at http://anthropology.msu.edu/anp455-fs14/assignments-grading/).  They created the wb page for the atlas entry (basic HTML, CSS, and some light JS if they felt ambitious), added the pin to the map by adding their site's information (Lat/Lon, time period, brief site description) to a CSV.  Leaflet Omnivore (https://github.com/mapbox/leaflet-omnivore) was used to pull the data out of the CSV and onto a simple Leaflet based map.  In addition to doing focused research and writing on a specific Egyptian archaeological site, students learned basic HTML/CSS and GitHub (forking, pull requests, comitting, etc) during the course of the assignment.  

The project has several goals.  First, it allowed the students to have focused engagement with a specific archaeological site (and write about the site).  Second, students learned some digital skills during the process, such as working with HTML, digital mapping skills, version control, etc (things that are normally not part of a senior level archaeology class...things that they can easily apply in other settings). Finally, students built something public, they contributed to the collective knowledge and resources available on the open web about the archaeology of ancient Egypt
